# Graphical JSON node manipulator
This project can manipulate JSON node graphically. It's implemented using Qt framework in C++. Since I am using the trial version, Qt doesn't allow me to create exe file.
So it must be opened and executed in QT software.
- Click load file to load the .json file in the window. I provided the sample input.json which I used for testing.
The  three QLabels are created based on the data of nodes in input.json. A QTextBrowser is created based on the data too.
- After the data is loaded, you can use the left button to drag labels into textBrowser.
- The Save button can be used to write Json output file for the shifted nodes.
- The Exit button supports the application shut down.
